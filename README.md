# Python-DSAs-CheatSheets
Cheat sheet I made for data structures &amp; algorithms, solutions to some common problems/interview questions.
Made this while taking Scott Barrett's Data Structures and Algorithms course on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-python/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING)
Great course that often goes on sale!! Includes help on getting your footing with Leetcode, a great resource for preparing for technical interviews.
Feel free to fork & use for yourself, enjoy!:)
